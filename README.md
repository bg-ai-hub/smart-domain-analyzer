# Smart Domain Analyzer

AI-powered tool to extract Domain-Driven Design (DDD) models from natural language business requirements.




## Overview
Smart Domain Analyzer is an AI-powered tool that converts plain-text business requirements into structured Domain-Driven Design (DDD) models. It uses LLMs like LLaMA (via Groq) to extract Domains, Subdomains, Aggregates, Entities, and their Attributes, outputting them in standardized JSON format.

ðŸ’¡ Use Case

Quickly generate draft DDD models from requirement documents to accelerate system design and align with business goals.

ðŸ§° Technologies

- Python: Core programming language for scripting and automation
- LangChain: Framework for orchestrating prompt engineering and LLM chains
- LLaMA: Back-end AI engines for natural language understanding and DDD structure generation



## Features

- Converts business requirements into structured DDD output (Domain, Subdomain, Aggregates, Entities).
