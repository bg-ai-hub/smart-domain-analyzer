Overview:
The online food ordering and delivery platform aims to streamline the process of connecting users with local restaurants, offering a seamless digital experience from meal selection to doorstep delivery. At its core, the platform supports essential features such as user registration and secure login, enabling access through email, phone number, and OTP-based authentication for convenience. Restaurants can onboard themselves by creating profiles and managing their menus, which are categorized into sections like Starters, Main Course, Desserts, and Beverages, along with controls for pricing, availability, and preparation time. Users will have the ability to explore restaurants based on location and cuisine, customize their orders with special instructions, and place them using a shopping cart interface. The system integrates multiple payment options including UPI, credit/debit cards, and digital wallets, with support for discounts and promo codes. Once an order is placed, users can track its progress in real time through distinct status updates—Order Confirmed, Preparing, Out for Delivery, and Delivered. Additionally, a dedicated module allows delivery partners to manage and update order statuses, with real-time location tracking during active deliveries. Post-delivery, the platform facilitates feedback through user ratings and reviews for both restaurants and delivery personnel, contributing to transparency and service quality.

Functional Requirements
The User Registration and Login module is designed to provide a secure, user-friendly entry point into the platform. Users should be able to register seamlessly using either their email address or mobile phone number, ensuring accessibility and flexibility. During the registration process, users will be required to set up a password, which must be stored using secure hashing techniques to protect against data breaches and unauthorized access. In addition to traditional login using email or phone number with a password, the system will support OTP-based authentication, offering users a quicker, passwordless login experience. This feature enhances convenience while maintaining security, especially for users accessing the platform from mobile devices. The module must also handle validation, duplicate account checks, and account recovery mechanisms such as forgot password flows, ensuring a complete and robust user onboarding and access experience.

Restaurant Management
The Restaurant Management module enables restaurants to independently register on the platform and create detailed business profiles that reflect their brand and offerings. Upon successful registration, each restaurant can configure and maintain its digital storefront, including essential details such as restaurant name, address, contact information, operating hours, and cuisine types. A core feature of this module is the ability for restaurants to manage their menus through a structured interface. Menus can be organized into intuitive categories such as Starters, Main Course, Desserts, and Beverages, helping users navigate and select items with ease. For each menu item, restaurants can define key attributes including pricing, availability status (in stock or temporarily unavailable), and estimated preparation time, which contributes to accurate delivery time estimates. The system should allow restaurants to make real-time updates to their menus, ensuring that changes in inventory or pricing are immediately reflected to end users. This autonomy empowers restaurants to manage their digital presence effectively, respond to customer preferences, and optimize operations on the platform.

Order Placement
The Order Placement functionality is central to the user experience, allowing customers to discover and engage with a wide range of restaurants in their vicinity. Users can browse restaurants through intuitive filters based on location and cuisine type, enabling them to quickly find options that suit their preferences. Once a restaurant is selected, users can explore its categorized menu and add desired items to a virtual cart. The platform supports item-level customization by allowing users to add special instructions for each selected dish—such as spice preferences, allergy notes, or packaging requests—ensuring personalized service. The cart provides a consolidated view of all selected items, with clear pricing, taxes, and applicable discounts. Once satisfied, users can proceed to place the order through a streamlined checkout process, initiating the fulfillment and delivery lifecycle. This feature-rich module enhances customer convenience while enabling restaurants to cater to specific user needs with precision.

Payment Integration
The Payment Integration module facilitates secure and flexible transaction processing, offering users multiple convenient options to complete their purchases. Customers can choose from a variety of payment methods including UPI (Unified Payments Interface), credit cards, debit cards, and digital wallets, ensuring compatibility with common user preferences across different regions and devices. The payment gateway must ensure encrypted transactions and compliance with relevant financial regulations such as PCI DSS, safeguarding sensitive user information. In addition to standard payment options, the system supports the application of discounts and promotional codes during checkout. Users can enter valid promo codes to receive instant discounts or special offers, which are dynamically reflected in the order summary. This feature not only enhances the user experience by offering savings but also provides a mechanism for targeted marketing campaigns and customer retention strategies. The integration should be seamless and responsive, minimizing transaction failures and enabling quick resolution in case of payment issues.

Order Tracking
The Order Tracking module enhances user transparency and engagement by providing real-time visibility into the status of their orders from the moment of placement to final delivery. Once an order is confirmed, the system initiates a dynamic status flow that reflects each stage of the fulfillment process. The status transitions include: Order Confirmed, indicating that the restaurant has acknowledged the order; Preparing, showing that the restaurant is actively cooking the items; Out for Delivery, where a delivery partner has picked up the order and is en route; and finally, Delivered, confirming successful handover to the customer. Each status update is communicated to the user through in-app notifications and/or SMS, ensuring timely updates without requiring manual refresh. Real-time tracking also includes live location sharing during the Out for Delivery phase, allowing users to view the delivery partner’s movement on a map. This functionality significantly improves user confidence and satisfaction by keeping them informed and reducing uncertainty throughout the delivery journey.

Delivery Partner Module
The Delivery Partner Module is designed to empower delivery personnel with the tools necessary to efficiently manage and fulfill their assigned orders. Delivery partners can securely log in to the platform and access a personalized dashboard displaying all current and upcoming delivery assignments. For each assigned order, partners can view key details such as pickup location, customer address, order items, and any special handling instructions. During the delivery lifecycle, partners are required to update the order status at key checkpoints—specifically at the time of pickup from the restaurant and upon successful delivery to the customer. These updates trigger real-time notifications to the user, maintaining transparency and order visibility. Additionally, the platform mandates location tracking during active deliveries, enabling the system to provide accurate Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) and live map-based tracking for customers. This not only enhances the delivery experience but also helps optimize delivery routes and monitor partner performance for operational efficiency.

Review and Rating
The Review and Rating module enables users to provide feedback on their dining and delivery experience, fostering a transparent and quality-driven ecosystem. After an order is successfully completed, users are prompted to rate both the restaurant and the delivery partner on predefined criteria such as food quality, packaging, delivery time, and service behavior. Ratings are typically captured on a 5-star scale, with an option to leave detailed written reviews. These reviews serve as valuable insights for future users and play a crucial role in building trust and aiding decision-making. All submitted reviews and average ratings are displayed publicly on the respective restaurant’s profile, contributing to its reputation and visibility on the platform. For delivery partners, ratings help assess performance and maintain service standards. The system may also use this feedback for internal evaluations, reward programs, or corrective actions, ensuring continuous improvement in both food and delivery services.

Admin Panel for Platform Management
The Admin Panel for Platform Management serves as the centralized control hub for overseeing and maintaining the operational integrity of the entire platform. It provides platform administrators with comprehensive tools to manage all key entities, including users, restaurants, delivery partners, support interactions, and promotional activities. Through this panel, admins can view, edit, or deactivate user accounts in case of suspicious activity or policy violations. Restaurant profiles can be monitored and verified to ensure compliance with platform guidelines, while onboarding new restaurants can be streamlined through a review and approval workflow. Similarly, delivery partner accounts can be managed to track performance, resolve complaints, or update status based on availability and compliance. The admin panel also includes a robust support ticket management system, enabling administrators to monitor and resolve customer complaints or queries efficiently. Additionally, the platform supports the creation and distribution of promo codes, with control over discount value, expiration dates, usage limits, and eligibility criteria. Reporting dashboards within the panel provide real-time insights into order volumes, revenue trends, service performance, and user engagement. By consolidating control functions into a single, intuitive interface, the admin panel ensures smooth governance, operational transparency, and the ability to rapidly respond to platform dynamics.

Loyalty and Reward Program
The Loyalty and Reward Program is designed to enhance user retention and incentivize repeat orders by offering tangible value for continued engagement. Under this program, users earn reward points for every successful transaction on the platform, with the number of points typically linked to the order value or promotional campaigns. These accumulated points are stored in the user’s profile and can be conveniently redeemed during future purchases for discounts or exclusive offers. The system should provide clear visibility of the earned, redeemed, and expiring points to users through their account dashboard. Additionally, the platform may introduce tiered loyalty levels (e.g., Silver, Gold, Platinum) based on user activity, with higher tiers unlocking additional benefits such as early access to offers, free delivery, or higher point multipliers. The loyalty program not only fosters user stickiness but also enables data-driven personalization of deals and promotions, thereby improving overall user satisfaction and lifetime value.
